- used jwt for sessions for added security
- stored session in localStorage and use it with the Authorization header
    - upside: good against csrf
    - downside: have to manually add it to the header
- made the api RESTful
- added ajax handling on login/signup so the page doesn't just redirect to a json response
- added pop-up to login/signup
- session no longer stored in db because the session contains the user object (username, email, role)
- i am going to crash out bcs the middleware won't work with the auth header
- caching added to a couple of APIs (mainly the ones that return a list of data like users or reports)
- made the dashboard kinda it's own single-page app, able to show the coresponding dashboard according to user role
- made the dashboard load changes when deleting something
- made report page check for auth client-side instead of server side bcs of restrictions
